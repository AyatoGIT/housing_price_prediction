Housing Price Prediction
Housing Price Prediction Model (Machine Learning Project)

Built a predictive model using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook to estimate housing prices.
Processed a dataset of 20,640 records, handling missing values and categorical features such as ocean proximity.
Engineered features like median income, population density, and household size to enhance model performance.
Trained and evaluated multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests) to optimize price prediction.
Assessed model accuracy using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and cross-validation techniques.
Visualized data distributions, correlations, and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
